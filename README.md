# PCUAE Installer Setup has now completed.
## PCUAE Installer Setup has now finished installing PCUAE.

## IF you have installed `PCUAE CBM Machine Edition`, then make sure you export `Favorite 1` to the `PCUAE USB Drive` in `PCUAE Manager` so `PCUAE Mode` loads the `Favorite 1 Carousel Gamelist screen`, otherwise it will load the gamelist from the firmware instead.

## In short PCUAE runs:

All the Carousel variations on TheC64, TheVic20, TheC64mini - you get to see all the other games as if you bought e.g. a PAL model from the UK when you would normally by NTSC

Additional games collections - lots of Carousels with up to 255 games each - customisable

VICE mode - run the Vice emulator in full for PET, Vic20 C64, C128, C64 DTV etc.

Other emulators e.g. Atari, SNES, PSX, ZX Spectrum Modes

Additional tools like change the clock speed, reset the Nand etc.

Make a TheVic20 boot up as a The400 and The400 into Thec64.

Also runs these things on other models like TheA500 Mini, The400, VCS+, Atari Gamestation.
